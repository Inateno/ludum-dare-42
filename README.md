# ludum-dare-42
My game entry for the LD42


I use grunt to concatenate all files in one big file, but the game runs fine without this if you test it in Chrome.

Backbone is used for complex GUI stuff

I use my own game engine (using PIXI for rendering) ![DreamEngine](https://github.com/inateno/dreamengine)
